------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 major Application platforms: Desktop and Web. 
Web is the most popular and widely used. 
Reachability is more. To read the web pages, U dont need any sp software other than what is installed in ur electronic Device: Web Browser. Clients can interact from any where across the globe with Internet as the medium of Communication. 
internet uses HTTP, a std for communicating or transfering content from one device to another. The device that holds the content is called Web Site and the device that reads the content thro a browser is called as Client. HTTP is a protocol used to interact with other machines using REQUEST-RESPONSE methodology. The requests are made using URL of the browser and the Response for the request comes from the host machine as HTML document.
------------------------------------------------------------------
We use HTML to create and develop Web pages that make up UR website. 
HTML is a markup language used to create Web pages. markup language is text based language where we use sp keywords called Tags to format the content of the text. The browser interprets these tags and decide how the content has to be presented in the browser. 
HTML pages are text based data. But can have other units like images, tables, lists, links, forms, audio and video along with graphical capabilities. 
As we use links to link one content with other, we called as Hyper Text Mark up language. HTML is not a programming language, it does have any logic while rendering the page. It contains only the markups and the content is presented in the browser based on is interpretation of that markup. 
These markups are standardized by a W3C(World Wide Web Consortium), a group which maintains the Web Development platform. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
HTML pages aredivment starts with a tag called <html> and will be ended with an end tag </html>. most of the tags in HTML will have an explicit end tag, but few have self enclosing tags. 

Every page has 2 parts: head section, body section.
head section will contain instructions to browsers, search engines, developers and is not visible to the end user. It also contains info like styling, external script files, exteral css files and many more. head section also allows to have a <title> which is used to display a text or title to Ur document.
Content that is created to be made visible to the users are created in the body section of the HTML document.  

In html, UR content is grouped into divisions or divs. div is a conceptual block within the html document. There is no restriction on the no of divs within the html doc.  div is a block element, it means it takes the complete width of the html document when it is created. 

usually classic html pages are bald in nature, they just maintain linear presentation with content coming one below the other. Everything will be in black and white. 
To enhance the look and the feel of the page, we use CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). 
3 ways to apply styles to html:
inline style: every tag will have style attribute and U can set to that element. 
internal style : Every HTML page will have a style tag that is usually kept in the head section where we apply styles to the elements of the document. 
External style: Seperate CSS files are created and are linked into the html document. This is done when U want to have a common look and feel for all the pages of UR website. 

paddding vs. margin:
padding is the gap U provide for the text and the border of the element. margin is the gap U provide b/w the elements or the container.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
tables in HTML:
table tag is used to create tables inside HTML docs. Its attribute called border is used to set the border for the table. Its value can be either 0(Default) or 1(Should have the border). 
Each Row of the table are represented using <tr> and ended with </tr>. 
Each Column inside the row is created using <td>(table data) and if the row represents a heading, it wil be <th>. U could create blocks within the table using <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot> tags.
U could use colspan to span one column across multiple columns in the row of the table.   
Real time usage of a Table would be a scenario where data is fetched from an External source as an array and U would iterate thro the array elements to dynamically add rows into the table.
